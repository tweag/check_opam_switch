This package provides utilities to easily check that an opam switch is
consistent with a given `opam.export` file generated by `opam switch
export`.

- The `check_opam_switch` binary reads the `opam.export` file passed
  as an argument, and checks that all of the packages are installed in
  the current switch at the specified version.

- The `dune_wrapper` binary does this same check before invocating dune.
It recovers the path of the `opam.export` file in the `DUNE_WRAPPER_OPAM_FILE` environment variable
(and does not do the check is this variable is not defined).

For instance, `dune_wrapper` can be used with the following alias:
```
dune="DUNE_WRAPPER_OPAM_FILE=/path/to/opam.export dune_wrapper"
```
This way you can continue to use dune as usual but be warned early that the opam switch needs to be updated.
